# Code App Documentation

We built it because there is nothing else on the App Store provides all these features in one app:

* A robust, high-performance text editor (Monaco Editor from Visual Studio Code)
* First class local file system support
* Extensive local language support
* SSH / FTP remote connection support (Files and terminal)
* Embedded emulated terminal
* Git Version Control
* Package manager support (pip and npm)
* Markdown, themes, server-side snippet execution and more

{% hint style="info" %}
While we want to make the editing experience as close as a desktop offers, Code App is still bounded by iOS's limitations. For example, you cannot download arbitary commands or modules with native components. Spawning subprocesses is also not possible.
